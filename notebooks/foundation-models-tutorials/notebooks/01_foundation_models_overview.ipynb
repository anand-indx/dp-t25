    "# Foundation Models in Digital Pathology\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern digital pathology is rapidly adopting foundation models (FMs): large, pre-trained image models (ResNet/ViT), vision-language models (CLIP), and promptable segmentation models (SAM). These enable zero-shot labeling, robust feature extraction, and downstream fine-tuning for slide-level tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "- When and how to use pre-trained CNNs/ViTs as feature extractors\n",
    "- Zero-shot classification with CLIP-like models for quick prototyping\n",
    "- Promptable segmentation with SAM for nuclei/tissue region initialization\n",
    "- How these pieces fit into a computational pathology pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roadmap in this track\n",
    "1. Feature extraction with `timm` (ResNet/ViT)\n",
    "2. Zero-shot histology concepts with CLIP\n",
    "3. Promptable segmentation with SAM (lightweight demo)\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on practical, binder-friendly recipes with optional installs in each notebook."
